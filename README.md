# Sorting Algorithms Visualization
---
This project visualize operating of three sorting algoritms:
1. Bubble Sort
1. Insertion Sort
1. Merge Sort

User can create a list that consists up to 800 elements that are inteegers represented by colums with height proportional to their values. The number of columns can be dynamically changed by entering a new value in the box, or increasing/decreasing it using the +/- signs. 
If the user is not satisfied with the distribution of the column heights, he may draw new ones. The width of the columns scales with their number so that they occupy 95% of the screen width.
The list is then sorted using the selected algorithm.

You can make a move by clicking on the field you want to place an X or O.

Importantly, the selected column configuration is remembered and can be sorted once again using a different algorithm. This and the fact that you can sort both small and relatively large amounts of data makes it easy to see the difference in the time of sorting different data sets with different algorithms.

Obviously, the larger the data set is, the greater the advantage of merge sort over the other algorithms.
